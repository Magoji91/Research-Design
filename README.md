# Research-Design


CONCEPT:
Experimental research projects aim to prove the hypotheses that affirm a causal relationship, but they are very susceptible to alternative explanations that threaten its internal validity.

Such experimental designs, which seek to maximize internal validity, are called randomized control or RCT trials. They have as characteristics: manipulation, comparison and random assignment.

I-) Manipulation: If you want to show a causal relationship, the strongest possible empirical demonstration is where the cause is under your control. If you can create a situation where the cause is present, a causal relationship is more plausible because you can show what precedes its effect, thus eliminating an ambiguous temporal precedence.

II-) Comparison: shows that the effect does not occur when the cause is absent. This also eliminates the threat of maturation.

III-) Random Assignment: there is no systematic difference between the different groups of the difference in the independent variable, the cause variable. The only way to be sure if randomized rework is correct is to replicate a study and show that the results are consistent.

RESUME:
So to summarize: manipulation ensures the cause and precedes its effect, comparison by means of a control group ensures the effect; and, random assignment ensures that there is no systematic difference between groups that could explain the effect. 

OBSERVATION: Replication is generally not considered a feature of a true experiment, but is necessary to test whether randomization actually works.
